# Excel_Project_Hospital_Emergency_Room


🚑 Emergency Room Dashboard Project Completed!
I recently had the opportunity to develop a comprehensive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard to monitor and analyze patient flow and care quality. This project allowed me to apply a full spectrum of data analysis and visualization skills in Power Query, Power Pivot, and Excel.

📌 Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Business Requirement Gathering
2️⃣ Understanding the Data
3️⃣ Data Connection using Power Query
4️⃣ Data Cleaning & Quality Checks
5️⃣ Calendar Table Creation
6️⃣ Data Modeling with Power Pivot
7️⃣ DAX Calculations for Key Metrics
8️⃣ Pivot Tables & Dashboard Layout Planning
9️⃣ Chart Development & Formatting
🔟 Final Dashboard Development
✅ Insight Generation for Informed Decision-Making

📊 Key KPIs & Visualizations:

No. of Patients: Trend analysis via area chart to identify peak days

Avg. Wait Time: Area chart to highlight bottlenecks

Patient Satisfaction Score: Visual trend line to correlate quality with wait times

Admission Status: Admitted vs. Not Admitted distribution

Age Group Breakdown: Patient age clusters (0–79)

Timeliness: % of patients seen within 30 minutes

Gender Analysis: Male vs. Female comparison

Department Referrals: Most common specialties referred to

📈 Result: A powerful, interactive report that gives healthcare managers the insights they need to improve service delivery, optimize patient flow, and enhance satisfaction.
