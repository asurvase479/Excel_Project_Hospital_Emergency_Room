4)Data cleaning and data quality check using power query
5)Crearting calender table using power query
6)Data Modelling using power pivot
7)Adding required columns (DAX calculation in power pivot)
8)Creating pivots and Dashboard lay outing
9)Charts Development and formatting
10)Dashboard report development
11)Insight generations


ðŸ“Œ KPI's Requiremnet
1)Number of patients
Count the total number of patients visiting the Emergency Room each day
show a daily trend with an area chart to spotpatterns like busy days or seasonal trends.

 2)Average Wait Time
Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professional.
Use an area chart to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that might need improvements

3)Patient Satisfaction Score
Check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to access service quality.
Use an area chart to show trends,spot drops in satisfaction and link them challenges

ðŸ“Œ Charts to create (Visualizations)
1)Patient Admission Status : Show how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted
2)Patient Age Distribution : Group patients by age
3)Timeliness : Mearsure tthe percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
4)Gender Analysis : Display the number of patients by gender
